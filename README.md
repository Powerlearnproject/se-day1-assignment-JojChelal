Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
-It is the application of engineering principles,methods and tools to the development and maintenance of software systems.
-It is used in enabling the creation of applications and systems that power various aspects of mordern life.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
-Development of programming languages
-Establishment of software engineering as a principle.
-Development of agile methodology.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements - gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
2. Design - creating high-level and detailed designs of software and user interface.
3. Implementation - code writing and building software according to the system design.
4. Testing - conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
5. Deployment - releasing the software to users and customers.
6. Maintenance - providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the deployed software.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
-Waterfall methodology deals with sequential approach in software development which is one phase at a time while agile methodology deals with iterative and increamental approach 
 with regards to flexibility, collaboration and change. Waterfall is used whereby the final product is known to be so that the development takes place in fixed stages while 
 agile is used whereby the final product is unknown and hence the flexibility and change is of importance when in development.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
-Software developer is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
-Quality assuarance engineer is responsible for enduring software quality by designing and executing test plans.
-Project manager oversees the planning, executing and delivery of software products.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
-IDEs are software tools used for writing, debugging and testing code in software development, for example Visual Studio Code.
-VCS are software tools used fot tracking changes made to source code, for example Github.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Changing requirements - when requirements of a software keeps changing throughout the project development causing delays and inconveniences.
2. Tight deadlines - when there is pressure to release software reuslting in rushed development and compromised quality of the software.
3. Technical debt - resulting from shortcuts taken and suboptimal solutions which may impede future development.
- These can be fixed bu effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks and regular re-assesment of goals and tasks.
   

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit - testing of individual components of software.
2. Intergration - testing interaction between components or system.
3. System - testing the system as a whole.
4. Acceptance - testing the software against user requirements.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
-Prompt engineering is crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models.
It's used in enhancing the AI models so as to get clear and concise responses and avoid confusion.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
-A vague prompt is "Give me and illustration of a town" and it can be improved by asking "Give me an illustration of an urban town"
 The improved prompt is more effective because it has specified how the town is supposed to look like and so the image generated by the AI will be more accurate as to what you had in mind.
